[Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/desktop) is the most popular [Linux distro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution)
for [personal computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer).

Regardless of whatever metric used in comparing Linux distros, it would be rare to come across any list of Linux
distros with Ubuntu missing. In fact, it is more likely for Ubuntu to be in top 3 than for it to be missing.

To paint a clearer picture of it's popularity, there are softwares that are branded as _"supported on Linux"_ but only
packaged for Ubuntu.

And for some end users, Linux is equivalent to Ubuntu and they use both termilogies interchangeably.

### Windows Orientation

Before my encounter with Linux, I have only exclusively used Windows.

I started as early as Windows 3.1 and pretty much interacted with every single version until Windows Vista,
the latest version at the time.

I did come across Apple computers on few ocassions, but in my head when I hear you say computer I interpreted that to
mean a device running Windows.

### Discovery of Linux

Due to penetration of the internet and my interest in programming, I noticed that Linux exists but it was just like any
other information you absorb without neccessarily giving it a second thought.

While internet is the norm today, there was a time that everything is offline first and you only go online when you need to.
Coupled with fact that internet speed and penetration was far from ideal in my location.

I would not give Linux a thought until my university days when I met some folks from our local Linux User Group who mentioned
Linux to me in more details.

I initially had no interest as I thought I could do and undo with Windows, but somehow the keywords "free" and "open source"
got me interested to try it out.

### Ubuntu to the rescue

The first distro I booted was [Mandriva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandriva_Linux) with [KDE desktop](https://kde.org/).
It was an eye opener for me as I properly explored an alternative to Windows for the first time, but I did not feel at home with it.

I somehow got to know about Ubuntu and the free CDs, and I ordered mine shortly after. The catch was not the fact that the
CDs are free but the free global delivery.

The shipping of CDs for free has been [discontinued](https://canonical.com/blog/shipit-comes-to-an-end), which makes
sense with the easier access to internet now. But back then, the CD would probably arrive quicker than it would take me to find a
network that is stable enough to download the Ubuntu iso without interruption.

### Free can be valuable

Unlike Mandriva, I instantly felt comfortable with Ubuntu and the rest is now history.
The iconic [Gnome 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_2) desktop with [Compiz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiz)
feels different and easy to use.

My path from that moment onwards has been heavily influenced by Linux.

With the _unfree_ Windows becoming adfested, getting something for free does not necessarily render it worthless.
Rather, it can be valuable.

It does cross my mind occasionally, what if I never got that free Ubuntu CD.

That was about 16 years ago, and I am still grateful today.

So, thank you Ubuntu.
